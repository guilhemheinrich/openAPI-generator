# openAPI-generator
Generate an humble client from a openAPI description file.

By humble, we mean that there is no typechecking of anysort, the generator use the least information avaiable to do a barebone client. By doing so, it hopes to be more robust to the various "errors" (or misses) that an OpenAPI spec file may contain.
